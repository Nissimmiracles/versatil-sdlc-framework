# V2.0.0 Testing - Next Steps

**Status**: Critical additions complete, ready for user validation
**Date**: 2025-09-30

---

## ✅ What's Complete (Just Built)

1. **Error Recovery** - `npm run recover`
2. **Debug Diagnostics** - `/framework:debug`
3. **5-Min Quickstart** - `QUICKSTART.md`
4. **GitHub Templates** - Bug reports + support
5. **Statusline Integration** - Real-time observability

---

## 🧪 4 Required Tests (You Must Run)

### Test 1: @-Mention Test (2 min)
```
@maria-qa check code quality
```

**What to test**:
- Does @-mention syntax work in Claude Code?
- Does Maria-QA respond?
- Different from `/maria-qa`?

**Expected**: May or may not be supported yet
**Fallback**: Use `/maria-qa` instead ✅

---

### Test 2: Framework Validation (2 min)
```
/validate
```

**What to test**:
- Does validation command exist?
- Checks isolation, configs, agents?
- Reports health status?

**Expected**: Should run comprehensive validation
**Note**: We have `/framework:doctor` working ✅

---

### Test 3: Statusline Updates (3 min)

**Steps**:
1. Run a long operation:
   ```
   /maria-qa run comprehensive test coverage analysis
   ```

2. Watch bottom statusline during execution

**What to observe**:
- Does statusline show progress?
- Real-time updates like `🤖 Maria-QA analyzing... 60%`?
- Or static until completion?

**Expected**:
- ✅ New hooks will emit events
- ⏳ Need to verify Claude Code displays them

---

### Test 4: Hook Triggering (3 min)

**Steps**:
1. Edit any file in framework, e.g., `src/index.ts`
2. Make a small change and save
3. Observe console/output

**What to look for**:
- Do hooks run automatically on file edit?
- Any console output from `.claude/hooks/`?
- Agent lifecycle logging?

**Expected**:
- ✅ Hooks should execute
- ⏳ Agent auto-activation needs runtime support

---

## 🎯 Key Clarification: Proactive vs Slash Commands

### What WORKS Today (Validated) ✅

**Slash Commands**:
```bash
/maria-qa review test coverage
/framework:doctor
/james-frontend optimize component
```

These are **100% working** - you've already validated 2 of them.

---

### What's CONFIGURED But Needs Testing ⏳

**Proactive Auto-Activation**:
- Edit `LoginForm.test.tsx` → Maria-QA activates automatically
- Edit `Button.tsx` → James activates automatically
- Edit `api/users.ts` → Marcus activates automatically

**Status**:
- ✅ Fully configured in `.cursor/settings.json:178-310`
- ✅ Code implemented in `ProactiveAgentOrchestrator`
- ⏳ Runtime integration with Claude Code unknown

**How to test**:
1. Create or open `example.test.ts`
2. Add test code:
   ```typescript
   describe('Test', () => {
     it('works', () => expect(true).toBe(true));
   });
   ```
3. Save file
4. **Observe**: Does Maria-QA activate without you typing `/maria-qa`?

**Expected Reality**:
- ⏳ Probably won't work yet (needs Claude Code runtime)
- ✅ Slash commands are the validated alternative

---

## 📊 Current Test Status

| Test | Status | Working Method |
|------|--------|---------------|
| Slash Commands | ✅ 2/6 validated | `/maria-qa`, `/framework:doctor` |
| @-mentions | ⏳ Not tested | Test: `@maria-qa check quality` |
| /validate | ⏳ Not tested | Test: `/validate` or `/framework:validate` |
| Statusline | ⏳ Not tested | Run `/maria-qa` and watch statusline |
| Hooks | ⏳ Not tested | Edit file, observe output |
| Proactive | ⏳ Not tested | Edit test file, wait for auto-activation |

---

## 🎯 Recommended Testing Order

### Phase 1: Validate What Should Work (10 min)

1. **Test Recovery**:
   ```bash
   npm run recover
   ```
   Expected: ✅ Should report framework health

2. **Test Debug**:
   ```
   /framework:debug
   ```
   Expected: ✅ Should create debug report

3. **Test Validation**:
   ```
   /validate
   ```
   or
   ```
   /framework:validate
   ```
   Expected: ✅ Should validate isolation/configs

4. **Test Statusline**:
   ```
   /maria-qa run comprehensive coverage analysis
   ```
   Watch bottom status bar
   Expected: ⏳ May show static or dynamic updates

---

### Phase 2: Test Proactive (Optional, 5 min)

5. **Create test file**:
   ```bash
   cat > example.test.ts <<EOF
   describe('Example', () => {
     it('should work', () => {
       expect(true).toBe(true);
     });
   });
   EOF
   ```

6. **Save and observe**:
   - Does Maria-QA activate automatically?
   - Any statusline changes?
   - Any console output?

7. **If nothing happens**:
   - ✅ Expected - proactive needs runtime support
   - ✅ Use slash commands: `/maria-qa review coverage`

---

### Phase 3: Test Hooks (Optional, 5 min)

8. **Edit any file**:
   - Open `src/index.ts`
   - Add a comment: `// test`
   - Save

9. **Observe**:
   - Terminal output?
   - Hook execution logs?
   - Agent activation?

10. **Check logs**:
    ```bash
    cat ~/.versatil/logs/agent-activity.log
    ```

## 💡 Key Insights

### Slash Commands = Validated ✅
You are **NOT dependent** on proactive features. Slash commands give you:
- ✅ All 6 agents accessible
- ✅ Full functionality
- ✅ Predictable behavior
- ✅ Works right now

### Proactive = Bonus Feature ⏳
If proactive auto-activation works:
- 🎉 Bonus! Seamless AI assistance
- 🎉 Zero user action required
- 🎉 True "co-pilot" experience

If it doesn't:
- ✅ No problem - slash commands do the same thing
- ✅ You just type the command explicitly
- ✅ Functionally equivalent

---

  - Release with working features
```

### If Tests Mostly Fail (0-1/4) ❌
```yaml

  - Run npm run recover
  - Check isolation
  - Re-test
```

## 🎯 Bottom Line

**You have 3 critical additions complete**:
1. ✅ Error recovery (`npm run recover`)
2. ✅ Debug diagnostics (`/framework:debug`)
3. ✅ Real-time observability (statusline hooks)

**Now test them** to verify they work in your Claude Code environment.

**Proactive auto-activation** is a bonus - if it works, great! If not, slash commands do the same thing.

**Time**: 10-15 minutes to test everything
**Outcome**: Know exactly what works, what doesn't, what to release
