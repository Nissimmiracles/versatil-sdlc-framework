# 🔧 VERSATIL Demo Fix Guide

## ✅ The Issue is Fixed!

The problem was that the project uses ES modules (`"type": "module"` in package.json) but the demo files used CommonJS syntax. I've fixed this by:

1. **Renaming files to .cjs extension** (CommonJS)
2. **Creating new demo runners** that work correctly
