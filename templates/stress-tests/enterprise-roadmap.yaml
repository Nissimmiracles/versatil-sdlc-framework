learnings_to_capture:
  technical:
    - "Multi-feature database schema design patterns"
    - "Feature dependency management (F1 blocks F2+F3)"
    - "Parallel feature development strategies"
    - "Integration testing across features"
    - "Production deployment best practices"

  process:
    - "How effective was parallel execution? (actual speedup vs estimated)"
    - "Where did agent handoffs cause bottlenecks?"
    - "What quality gates were most valuable?"
    - "What would enable better feature parallelization?"

  improvements:
    - "What patterns can be extracted for v2.0?"
    - "What feature dependencies could be eliminated?"
    - "What testing strategy caught most bugs?"
    - "What documentation would speed up next release?"

next_iteration_expectations:
  with_learning:
    estimated_effort: "60 hours (-29%)"
    confidence: 85
    improvements:
      - "Reuse auth system structure"
      - "Reuse dashboard components"
      - "Reuse payment integration patterns"
      - "Copy test suites (80% reusable)"
      - "Apply learned parallel execution strategies"
      - "Compounding effect: v2.0 will be 29% faster"

risk_assessment:
  high_risk:
    - risk: "Feature dependencies block parallelization (F1 blocks F2+F3)"
      probability: "certain"
      impact: "28 hours sequential (no parallel until auth done)"
      mitigation: "Prioritize F1 completion, use feature flags for early testing"

    - risk: "Integration issues between features"
      probability: "medium"
      impact: "1-2 days debugging (8-16 hours)"
      mitigation: "Daily integration tests, early Maria-QA involvement"

  medium_risk:
    - risk: "Stripe API changes during development"
      probability: "low"
      impact: "4-8 hours rework"
      mitigation: "Use specific Stripe API version, test webhooks early"

    - risk: "Scope creep (stakeholders add features)"
      probability: "medium"
      impact: "+20-40% effort"
      mitigation: "Lock requirements after Phase 1, defer to v2.0"

  low_risk:
    - risk: "Team member unavailable (illness, vacation)"
      probability: "medium"
      impact: "1-2 days delay"
      mitigation: "Cross-training, knowledge sharing, documentation"
