## 🎯 Recommended Actions (Priority Order)

1. Issue verified but no clear fix available

## 📊 Execution Strategy

**Suggested Approach**:

1. **Auto-Apply (1 issues)**: Guardian can automatically remediate these high-confidence issues
   - Review auto-fix logs after execution
   - Verify changes before committing


**Estimated Effort**: 15-30 minutes (depending on complexity)

## 🧠 Learning Opportunity

After resolving these issues:
1. Run `/learn "Resolved 1 critical issues in framework layer"`
2. Guardian will store fix patterns in RAG
3. Similar issues will be auto-remediable in the future (compounding engineering)

## 🔍 Verification Details

All issues verified using Chain-of-Verification (CoVe) methodology:
- Layer Classification (framework/project/context)
- Ground Truth Verification (file system, git, logs)
- Agent Assignment (based on specialization)
- Confidence Scoring (0-100%)

**Full verification evidence available in individual issue sections above.**
