# 🚀 Enhancement Suggestion - Improve build reliability

## 🔐 Approval Status

- **Approval Tier**: 🔴 **TIER 3** - Manual Review Required
- **Approval Required**: YES
- **Reason**: Critical priority requires explicit approval

### Manual Review Actions

🔴 **This enhancement requires careful manual review** (low confidence <80% or high risk).

**Review Checklist**:
- [ ] Verify root cause analysis is accurate
- [ ] Confirm implementation steps are appropriate
- [ ] Check for potential side effects
- [ ] Validate estimated effort and ROI
- [ ] Test in non-production environment first

**Commands**:
- `/work enhancement-reliability-critical-1761757665812-cvn0.md` - Start implementation with assigned agent (Maria-QA)
- `/approve enhancement-reliability-1761757665803-sodc` - Force approval (after manual review)
- `/reject enhancement-reliability-1761757665803-sodc "reason"` - Reject permanently

## Pattern Detected

**Issue**: Build failed: Command failed: npm run build

**Occurrences**: 3 times in past 24h
**Root Cause Pattern**: root-cause-1761757665794-eown

## Current Impact

- **Manual Interventions**: 21 per week
- **Time Spent**: 5.3h per week on manual fixes
- **Reliability Impact**: 12.4% improvement possible

## Suggested Enhancement

**Goal**: Address recurring build issues. Current issue occurs 3 times per 24h requiring manual intervention.

**Category**: 🛡️ Reliability
**Estimated Effort**: 2.5 hours
**Assigned Agent**: **Maria-QA**

## Implementation Steps

1. Update Guardian telemetry to track fix success rate
2. Store learned pattern in RAG for future reference

## Expected Benefits

- ✅ **Reduce manual intervention**: 21 interventions/week → 0
- ✅ **Save time**: 5.3h/week freed for feature development
- ✅ **Improve reliability**: 12.4% reliability improvement
- ✅ **Auto-remediation**: Partial - Requires monitoring

## Supporting Evidence

- **Verification Confidence**: 85%
- **Expected Success Rate**: 95%
- **Issue Occurrences**: 3

## ROI Calculation

```
Implementation Time: 2.5h
Time Saved per Week: 5.3h
Break-even: 0.5 weeks
Annual Savings: 276h/year
```

## ⚠️ Manual Review Required

This enhancement requires human judgment due to:
- Priority: CRITICAL
- Complexity: 2 implementation steps
- Confidence: 85% (< 90% threshold for full automation)

**Review Checklist**:
- [ ] Verify root cause analysis is accurate
- [ ] Confirm implementation steps are appropriate
- [ ] Check for potential side effects
- [ ] Validate estimated effort

## 🧠 Learning Opportunity

After implementing this enhancement:

1. Run `/learn "Implemented Improve build reliability"`
2. Guardian will store the fix pattern in RAG
3. Similar issues will be auto-remediable in the future
4. Compounding engineering: Next similar issue will be 40% faster to fix
