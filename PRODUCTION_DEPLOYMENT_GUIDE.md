## 📋 STEP 1: ENVIRONMENT CONFIGURATION (REQUIRED)

### 🔑 Configure Your Production Environment

The `.env` file has been created from the template. **You must update it with your actual credentials** before deployment:

```bash
# Edit the .env file with your actual production credentials
nano .env  # or use your preferred editor
```

### 🚨 CRITICAL: Update These Values

```env
# Supabase Production Configuration (REQUIRED)
SUPABASE_URL=https://YOUR-PROJECT-REF.supabase.co
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-actual-anon-key-here
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-actual-service-role-key-here
SUPABASE_PROJECT_REF=your-actual-project-ref
SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN=your-actual-access-token

# OpenAI Configuration (REQUIRED)
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-actual-openai-api-key-here

# Optional: GitHub Integration
GITHUB_TOKEN=your-github-token-if-needed
```

### 📚 How to Get Your Supabase Credentials

1. **Go to**: [https://supabase.com/dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard)
2. **Select your project** or create a new one
3. **Navigate to**: Settings → API
4. **Copy**:
   - Project URL → `SUPABASE_URL`
   - anon/public key → `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
   - service_role key → `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`
5. **For Project Ref**: Extract from URL (e.g., `abc123` from `https://abc123.supabase.co`)
6. **For Access Token**: Settings → Access Tokens → Generate new token

## 📋 STEP 2: VALIDATION & DEPLOYMENT

### 🔍 Validate Environment

```bash
# Validate your configuration
npm run edge:validate
```

**Expected Output:**
```
✅ Environment validation passed
✅ Function files validated
✅ Pre-deployment checks passed
```

### 🚀 Deploy to Production

```bash
# Deploy all edge functions with verification
npm run edge:deploy:verify
```

**Expected Output:**
```
🚀 VERSATIL Edge Function Deployment

✅ opera-agent deployed successfully
✅ maria-rag deployed successfully
✅ james-rag deployed successfully
✅ marcus-rag deployed successfully
✅ store-memory deployed successfully
✅ query-memories deployed successfully
✅ context-fusion deployed successfully

🎉 Edge function deployment completed successfully!
```

### 🏥 Verify Health

```bash
# Check health of all deployed functions
npm run edge:health
```

**Expected Output:**
```
🏥 Edge Function Health Check

opera-agent: ✅ Healthy
maria-rag: ✅ Healthy
james-rag: ✅ Healthy
marcus-rag: ✅ Healthy
store-memory: ✅ Healthy
query-memories: ✅ Healthy
context-fusion: ✅ Healthy

📊 Overall Health: 7/7 functions healthy
```

---

## 📋 STEP 3: COMPREHENSIVE TESTING

### 🧪 Run Full Test Suite

```bash
# Execute comprehensive integration tests
npm run test:edge-functions
```

**Expected Test Results:**
- ✅ Health Checks: 7/7 functions
- ✅ OPERA Agent Functionality: 6/6 agents
- ✅ Rate Limiting: Active and working
- ✅ Caching Behavior: Optimized performance
- ✅ Performance Benchmarks: < 200ms response times
- ✅ Error Handling: Comprehensive coverage
- ✅ Security Headers: CORS and security validated
- ✅ Monitoring Endpoints: Metrics collection active

## 📋 STEP 4: PRODUCTION ENDPOINTS

### 🌐 Your Production URLs

Once deployed, your main endpoint will be:
```
https://YOUR-PROJECT-REF.supabase.co/functions/v1/opera-agent
```

### 🔗 API Endpoints

```bash
# Health Check
curl https://YOUR-PROJECT-REF.supabase.co/functions/v1/opera-agent/health \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ANON_KEY"

# Metrics
curl https://YOUR-PROJECT-REF.supabase.co/functions/v1/opera-agent/metrics \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ANON_KEY"

# OPERA Agent Request
curl -X POST https://YOUR-PROJECT-REF.supabase.co/functions/v1/opera-agent \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ANON_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "agent": "enhanced-maria",
    "action": "analyze",
    "context": {
      "filePath": "test.js",
      "content": "function test() { return true; }",
      "language": "javascript"
    }
  }'
```
