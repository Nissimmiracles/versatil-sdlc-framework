# Compounding Engineering Skill

**Auto-invoked during**: Feature planning, `/plan` command, effort estimation

Make each feature 40% faster than the last through systematic learning and proven patterns.

## What This Skill Provides

Three bash-executable services that power compounding engineering:

1. **Pattern Search** - Find similar historical features (GraphRAG/Vector stores)
2. **Template Matcher** - Match features to proven YAML templates
3. **Todo Generator** - Create dual todo system with dependency graphs

**Result**: Features 2-5 are 17% → 40% faster than baseline

## When to Use

Use this skill when you need to:

- **Plan new features** - `/plan "Add user authentication"`
- **Estimate effort** - Get historical data (±10-20% vs ±50% without)
- **Research implementations** - Find similar past work
- **Create todos** - Generate dual tracking system
- **Avoid mistakes** - Consolidated lessons from similar features

## Quick Start

### 1. Pattern Search

Find similar historical features:

```bash
! npx tsx .claude/skills/compounding-engineering/scripts/execute-pattern-search.ts \
  --description "Add user authentication" \
  --min-similarity 0.75
```

**Returns**: Top 5 similar features with effort estimates, confidence scores, lessons learned

**Key Feature**: GraphRAG-first routing (offline, no API quota)

---

### 2. Template Matching

Match to proven templates:

```bash
! npx tsx .claude/skills/compounding-engineering/scripts/execute-template-matcher.ts \
  --description "Add user authentication"
```

**5 Templates Available**:
- `auth-system` - OAuth2, JWT, sessions (28h baseline)
- `crud-endpoint` - REST API CRUD operations (8h)
- `dashboard` - Analytics with charts (16h)
- `api-integration` - Third-party APIs (12h)
- `file-upload` - Secure file upload (10h)

**Threshold**: 70% match score required

---

### 3. Todo Generation

Create dual todo system:

```bash
! npx tsx .claude/skills/compounding-engineering/scripts/execute-todo-generator.ts \
  --specs-json '[{"title":"Setup auth","priority":"p1",...}]'
```

**Generates**:
- TodoWrite items (in-session tracking)
- `todos/*.md` files (cross-session persistence)
- Dependency graph (Mermaid)
- Execution waves (parallel vs sequential)

---

## Integration with /plan Command

**Automatic workflow**:

```bash
/plan "Add user authentication"
  ↓
1. Pattern Search → Finds 3 similar auth features (avg 27h ± 4h, 88% confidence)
2. Template Match → Matches auth-system.yaml (88% score, 28h baseline)
3. Combined Estimate → 29h ± 3h (91% confidence - WAY better than ±50%)
4. Todo Generation → Creates 6 todo files + TodoWrite items
5. Output → Confidence scores, risk assessment, execution waves
```

**Result**: Accurate estimates + historical learnings + proven patterns = 40% faster

---

## Compounding Effect

**How it works**:

- **Feature 1**: 100% effort (baseline, no patterns yet)
- **Feature 2**: 83% effort (17% faster - learn from Feature 1)
- **Feature 3**: 74% effort (26% faster - learn from 1+2)
- **Feature 4**: 69% effort (31% faster)
- **Feature 5**: **60% effort** (40% faster) ← **Target achieved!**

**Formula**: More features implemented = More patterns stored = Faster future features

---

## Service Details

For complete API documentation, examples, and troubleshooting:

- **Pattern Search**: See `references/pattern-search-api.md`
  - Store routing chain (GraphRAG → Vector → Local)
  - Anti-hallucination gates (5 quality checks)
  - Quality scoring (0-100)

- **Template Matcher**: See `references/template-matcher-api.md`
  - Scoring algorithm (keywords + category + name)
  - Template specifications (5 YAML files)
  - Custom templates (how to add your own)

- **Todo Generator**: See `references/todo-generator-api.md`
  - TodoFileSpec schema
  - Dependency graph generation
  - Execution wave detection

---

## Critical Requirements

1. **GraphRAG preferred** - Always try GraphRAG first (offline, no quota)
2. **70% threshold** - Template must score ≥70% to be used
3. **Dual todo system** - Both TodoWrite + markdown files
4. **Graceful degradation** - Services return valid JSON even on failure

---

## Success Metrics

- **Effort Accuracy**: ±10-20% (vs ±50% without patterns)
- **Compounding Effect**: 40% faster by feature 5
- **Pattern Quality**: 95/100 average (with anti-hallucination gates)
- **Time Savings**: ~10-30 hours per feature (on average)

---

## Common Use Cases

**New feature planning**:
```bash
/plan "Add payment processing with Stripe"
# Pattern search finds similar payment integrations
# Template matcher suggests api-integration template
# Combined: Accurate estimate with proven approach
```

**Research similar work**:
```bash
# Ask: "Have we built authentication before?"
# Skill automatically triggers → Pattern search
# Returns: 3 auth implementations with lessons learned
```

**Estimate effort**:
```bash
# Pattern search: avg 27h (24-30h range, 95% confidence)
# Template match: 28h baseline
# Result: 27-29h estimate (±7% variance)
```

---

## Error Handling

All services return graceful JSON errors:

```json
{
  "error": "GraphRAG initialization failed",
  "patterns": [],
  "search_method": "degraded",
  "recommended_approach": "Proceed with template-based planning"
}
```

**Fallback strategy**: GraphRAG fails → Vector store → Local → Empty (never crashes)

---

## Performance

- **Pattern Search**: 200-500ms (GraphRAG), 1-2s (Vector fallback)
- **Template Matcher**: 50-100ms (local YAML parsing)
- **Todo Generator**: 100-200ms per todo file

**Total /plan overhead**: ~500ms - 2s for 40% faster development
