# Quality Gates Skill

**Auto-invoked during**: Pre-commit hooks, PR reviews, deployment validation, `/review` command

Execute automated quality validation to enforce BMAD (Best Measured Automated Defensively) standards.

## What This Skill Provides

Three automated quality checks:

1. **Test Coverage** - Ensure 80%+ coverage across all code
2. **TypeScript Compilation** - Verify no type errors
3. **Contract Validation** - Check agent handoff contracts

**Result**: Block bad commits, ensure production readiness

## When to Use

Use this skill when you need to:

- **Pre-commit validation** - Check quality before committing
- **PR review automation** - Automated code review checks
- **Deployment gates** - Ensure production readiness
- **Quality enforcement** - BMAD standards (80%+ coverage)

## Quick Start

### Run All Quality Gates

```bash
! npx tsx .claude/skills/quality-gates/scripts/execute-validation.ts \
  --check all \
  --threshold 80
```

**Returns**: Overall status (PASSED/FAILED) + results for all 3 checks

**Exit Code**: 0 if all pass, 1 if any fail

---

### Individual Checks

**Coverage only**:
```bash
! npx tsx .claude/skills/quality-gates/scripts/execute-validation.ts \
  --check coverage \
  --threshold 80
```

**TypeScript only**:
```bash
! npx tsx .claude/skills/quality-gates/scripts/execute-validation.ts \
  --check typescript
```

**Contracts only**:
```bash
! npx tsx .claude/skills/quality-gates/scripts/execute-validation.ts \
  --check contracts
```

---

## Quality Standards (BMAD)

**Best Measured Automated Defensively** - Maria-QA enforces:

| Check | Standard | Blocking |
|-------|----------|----------|
| **Test Coverage** | 80%+ (90%+ for security code) | ✅ Yes |
| **TypeScript** | Zero type errors | ✅ Yes |
| **Contracts** | Valid agent handoffs | ⚠️ Warning |
| **Performance** | Tests <15s | ⚠️ Warning |

**Coverage Breakdown**:
- Lines: 80%+
- Statements: 80%+
- Functions: 80%+
- Branches: 75%+

---

## Integration with Commands

**`/review` command**: Runs all quality gates
```bash
/review feature/auth
# Internally: execute-validation.ts --check all
```

**Pre-commit hook**: Validates before commit
```bash
git commit -m "Add auth"
# Hook runs: execute-validation.ts --check all
# Blocks commit if validation fails
```

---

## Return Format

```json
{
  "overall_status": "PASSED",
  "checks_run": 3,
  "checks_passed": 3,
  "checks_failed": 0,
  "results": [
    {
      "check": "coverage",
      "passed": true,
      "score": 87,
      "threshold": 80,
      "message": "Test coverage: 87% (threshold: 80%)"
    },
    {
      "check": "typescript",
      "passed": true,
      "message": "TypeScript compilation successful - no type errors"
    },
    {
      "check": "contracts",
      "passed": true,
      "message": "Agent contract validation passed"
    }
  ]
}
```

---

## Critical Requirements

1. **80% minimum coverage** - Non-negotiable (Maria-QA standard)
2. **Security code = 90%** - Higher bar for auth/crypto/security
3. **Zero TypeScript errors** - No type safety compromises
4. **Fast execution** - All checks complete in <1 minute

---

## Common Use Cases

**Before committing**:
```bash
# Check quality
! execute-validation.ts --check all

# If PASSED → safe to commit
# If FAILED → fix issues before committing
```

**During code review**:
```bash
# Automated review checks
/review feature/auth

# Quality gates run automatically
# Report shows what needs fixing
```

**Before deployment**:
```bash
# Full validation
! execute-validation.ts --check all

# Must pass all gates for production
```

---

## Error Handling

**Graceful failure** - Returns structured JSON even on errors:

```json
{
  "overall_status": "FAILED",
  "checks_run": 3,
  "checks_passed": 1,
  "checks_failed": 2,
  "results": [
    {
      "check": "coverage",
      "passed": false,
      "score": 65,
      "threshold": 80,
      "message": "Test coverage: 65% (threshold: 80%) - BELOW THRESHOLD"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Fallback strategy**: Individual check failures don't crash - all checks complete

---

## Performance

- **Coverage check**: 10-30s (runs full test suite)
- **TypeScript check**: 5-10s (compilation only)
- **Contracts check**: 2-5s (validation tests)
- **All checks**: 20-45s total
