# OPERA Agent Team - Detailed Configuration

This document defines the detailed configuration for all 7 OPERA agents in the VERSATIL SDLC Framework, including the new **Dana-Database** agent for three-tier coordination.

---

## üèóÔ∏è Three-Tier Architecture Support

VERSATIL now provides **simultaneous frontend, backend, and database attention** for every task through:

- **Dana-Database**: Database schema, migrations, RLS policies, query optimization
- **Marcus-Backend**: API layer, business logic, authentication, middleware
- **James-Frontend**: UI components, state management, responsive design, accessibility

### Three-Tier Collaboration Patterns

#### Pattern 1: API-First Development
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Alex-BA: Define API Contract] --> B[Parallel Phase]
    B --> C[Dana: Database Schema]
    B --> D[Marcus: API with DB Mocks]
    B --> E[James: UI with API Mocks]
    C --> F[Integration: Dana ‚Üí Marcus]
    D --> F
    E --> G[Integration: Marcus ‚Üí James]
    F --> G
    G --> H[Maria-QA: End-to-End Validation]
```

**Time Savings**: 2-3x faster than sequential (Database ‚Üí Backend ‚Üí Frontend)

**Workflow**:
1. **Alex-BA** defines API contract (endpoints + request/response schemas)
2. **Parallel Development** (Rule 1):
   - **Dana-Database**: Designs database schema matching API contract
   - **Marcus-Backend**: Implements API with mock database
   - **James-Frontend**: Builds UI with mock API
3. **Integration Phase**:
   - Dana hands off real database to Marcus
   - Marcus hands off real API to James
4. **Maria-QA** validates end-to-end with all layers integrated

#### Pattern 2: Database-First Development
```yaml
Step_1: Dana-Database
  - Design complete data model
  - Create migrations
  - Add RLS policies

Step_2: Marcus-Backend (uses Dana's schema)
  - Build CRUD APIs for data model
  - Add business logic on top of schema

Step_3: James-Frontend (uses Marcus's APIs)
  - Create admin UI for data management
  - Build user-facing features
```

#### Pattern 3: Schema Changes & Migrations
```yaml
Coordinated_Deployment:
  1. Dana-Database:
     - Create migration for schema change
     - Test migration on staging database

  2. Marcus-Backend:
     - Update API types to match new schema
     - Modify queries for schema changes
     - Add endpoints for new tables/fields

  3. James-Frontend:
     - Update TypeScript types
     - Modify UI components for new data structure

  4. Deployment_Order:
     - Database first (run migration)
     - Backend second (deploy API updates)
     - Frontend third (deploy UI updates)
```
