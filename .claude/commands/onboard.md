# VERSATIL Onboarding Wizard

**Welcome to VERSATIL SDLC Framework!** Let's set up your AI-native development environment in just a few minutes.

This interactive wizard will guide you through:
- üîç **Project analysis** - Auto-detect your tech stack
- üë• **Team setup** - Configure for your workflow
- ü§ñ **Agent customization** - Choose which OPERA agents to enable
- üîß **MCP tools** - Select integrations you need
- üìç **Roadmap generation** - Get a personalized 4-week plan

---

## Quick Start (Auto Mode)

If you want automatic setup with smart defaults:

```
I'll run auto-detection now and configure everything based on your project.
```

**Detected**:
- **Project Type**: (will analyze package.json, file structure)
- **Tech Stack**: (will detect React, TypeScript, Node.js, etc.)
- **Recommended Agents**: (will suggest based on tech stack)

---

## Custom Setup (Interactive Mode)

Let's personalize your setup step-by-step:

### Step 1: Project Analysis üîç

**What type of project are you working on?**

| Option | Project Type | Recommended Agents |
|--------|-------------|-------------------|
| 1 | **Frontend** (React, Vue, Angular) | James-Frontend, Maria-QA |
| 2 | **Backend** (Node.js, Python, Java) | Marcus-Backend, Dana-Database, Maria-QA |
| 3 | **Full-stack** (Frontend + Backend) | All agents |
| 4 | **Mobile** (React Native, Flutter) | James-Frontend, Marcus-Backend |
| 5 | **ML/AI** (Python, TensorFlow) | Dr.AI-ML, Marcus-Backend, Maria-QA |
| 6 | **Enterprise** (Microservices, Complex) | All agents + Sarah-PM, Alex-BA |

**Choose (1-6)**: _[User responds with number]_

---

### Step 2: Team & Experience Setup üë•

**What's your team size?**

- [ ] Solo developer
- [ ] Small team (2-5 people)
- [ ] Medium team (6-15 people)
- [ ] Large team (16+ people)

**Your experience with AI-assisted development?**

- [ ] Beginner (New to AI tools)
- [ ] Intermediate (Some experience with GitHub Copilot, etc.)
- [ ] Expert (Experienced with multiple AI development tools)

**Main development priorities?** (select multiple)

- [ ] Speed/Velocity
- [ ] Code Quality
- [ ] Testing/QA
- [ ] Security
- [ ] Performance
- [ ] Team Collaboration

---

### Step 3: OPERA Agent Customization ü§ñ

Based on your selections, I'll configure these agents:

#### ‚úÖ Maria-QA (Quality Guardian)
- **Auto-activation**: ‚úÖ Enabled
- **Priority**: 10/10 (High)
- **Triggers**: `*.test.*`, `*.spec.*`, `__tests__/**`
- **Focus**: Automated testing, Visual regression, Performance testing, Accessibility audits

**Customize?** (Y/n): _[User can adjust priority, triggers, focus areas]_

#### ‚úÖ James-Frontend (UI/UX Expert)
- **Auto-activation**: ‚úÖ Enabled
- **Priority**: 7/10 (Medium-High)
- **Triggers**: `*.tsx`, `*.jsx`, `*.vue`, `*.css`
- **Focus**: Component optimization, Performance monitoring, Design system

**Customize?** (Y/n):

#### ‚úÖ Marcus-Backend (API Architect)
- **Auto-activation**: ‚úÖ Enabled
- **Priority**: 7/10 (Medium-High)
- **Triggers**: `*.api.*`, `routes/**`, `server/**`
- **Focus**: API design, Database optimization, Security auditing

**Customize?** (Y/n):

_(Continue for all selected agents...)_

---

### Step 4: MCP Tool Configuration üîß

**Which MCP tools would you like to enable?**

| MCP Tool | Purpose | Agents Using It | Auto-Enable? |
|----------|---------|----------------|--------------|
| **Playwright/Chrome** | Browser automation, E2E testing | Maria-QA, James | ‚úÖ Recommended |
| **GitHub** | Repository operations, PR reviews | Marcus, Sarah, Alex | ‚úÖ Recommended |
| **Exa Search** | AI-powered research | Alex-BA, Dr.AI-ML | Optional |
| **Vertex AI** | Google Cloud AI, ML deployment | Dr.AI-ML | Optional (ML projects) |
| **Supabase** | Vector database, RAG memory | All agents | ‚úÖ Recommended |
| **n8n** | Workflow automation | Sarah-PM | Optional |
| **Semgrep** | Security scanning | Marcus, Maria | ‚úÖ Recommended |
| **Sentry** | Error monitoring | Maria, Sarah | Optional |

**Select tools** (comma-separated, e.g., "1,2,5,7" or "all" for recommended):

---

### Step 4.5: Service Credentials Setup üîê

**üîí Security: Project-Level Encryption**

Credentials will be encrypted with AES-256-GCM and stored at:
`<project>/.versatil/credentials.json`

Each project has its own isolated credentials - no cross-project access!

**Which services need credentials?**

Based on your MCP selections, these services require setup:

| Service | Required By | Priority | Status |
|---------|-------------|----------|--------|
| **GitHub** | Marcus, Sarah, Alex | ‚úÖ High | Auto-detect `GITHUB_TOKEN` |
| **Supabase** | RAG memory, All agents | ‚úÖ High | Check existing config |
| **Vertex AI** | Dr.AI-ML | Medium | GCP service account |
| **Semgrep** | Marcus, Maria | Medium | Auto-detect `SEMGREP_TOKEN` |

**Configure now or later?**
- **[Y] Configure now** (recommended) - 2-3 minutes, guided setup
- **[n] Skip for now** (can run `versatil-credentials setup` later)

**What happens:**
1. Interactive prompts for each credential (with validation)
2. Encrypted storage with AES-256-GCM (project-specific key)
3. Audit logging for all credential access
4. Team export option (password-protected)

---

### Step 4.6: Private RAG Storage Setup (Optional) üîí

**üåç Public vs üîí Private RAG**

VERSATIL uses two separate RAG stores:

| Type | Purpose | Storage | Data Examples |
|------|---------|---------|---------------|
| **üåç Public RAG** | Framework patterns for coding excellence | Cloud (managed by VERSATIL) | React patterns, JWT auth, testing best practices |
| **üîí Private RAG** | Your proprietary project memory | **Your choice** (Firestore/Supabase/Local) | Company-specific code, internal APIs, client work |

**Key Benefits**:
- ‚úÖ **Zero data leaks** - Your private patterns NEVER leave your storage
- ‚úÖ **Privacy first** - Public RAG contains ONLY generic framework patterns
- ‚úÖ **Intelligent routing** - Private patterns prioritized over public
- ‚úÖ **Free tier available** - Firestore (1GB) or Supabase (500MB) or Local ($0)

**Do you want to configure Private RAG storage?**

- **[Y] Yes, configure now** (recommended for proprietary projects) - 3 minutes
- **[n] Skip for now** (use Public RAG only, can add later with `npm run setup:private-rag`)

**If you choose YES, you'll select from:**

#### Option 1: Google Cloud Firestore (Recommended)
- ‚úÖ Free tier: 1GB storage, 50K reads/day, 20K writes/day
- ‚úÖ Best performance with Cloud Run edge acceleration
- ‚úÖ Auto-scaling, 99.9% SLA
- üì¶ Cost after free tier: $0.18/GB/month + $0.06/100K reads

**Setup**: Provide your Google Cloud project ID and service account JSON

#### Option 2: Supabase pgvector
- ‚úÖ Free tier: 500MB storage, unlimited API requests
- ‚úÖ Full PostgreSQL database (not just vectors)
- ‚úÖ Built-in auth, real-time subscriptions
- üì¶ Cost after free tier: $25/month (Pro plan)

**Setup**: Provide your Supabase URL and anon key

#### Option 3: Local JSON (Offline)
- ‚úÖ 100% free, unlimited storage
- ‚úÖ Works offline, no cloud dependencies
- ‚úÖ Fast for small datasets (<1000 patterns)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è No cross-device sync, manual backups

**Setup**: Automatically uses `~/.versatil/private-rag/` directory

---

**What happens during Private RAG setup:**
1. Interactive wizard guides you through storage selection
2. Credentials saved to `~/.versatil/.env` (encrypted)
3. Connection tested automatically
4. Pattern classification enabled (auto-route to public/private)

**Run setup wizard anytime**:
```bash
npm run setup:private-rag
```

---

### Step 5: Configuration Preview ‚öôÔ∏è

Here's your personalized configuration:

```json
{
  "projectType": "fullstack",
  "teamSize": "small",
  "experience": "intermediate",
  "technologies": ["TypeScript", "React", "Node.js", "Express"],
  "priorities": ["Quality", "Testing", "Speed"],
  "agentCustomizations": {
    "Maria-QA": { "priority": 10, "autoActivate": true },
    "James-Frontend": { "priority": 7, "autoActivate": true },
    "Marcus-Backend": { "priority": 7, "autoActivate": true },
    "Dana-Database": { "priority": 6, "autoActivate": true }
  },
  "mcpPreferences": ["playwright_mcp", "github_mcp", "supabase_mcp", "semgrep"]
}
```

**Confirm and proceed?** (Y/n):

### Step 6: Generate Personalized Roadmap ‚≠ê AGENT-DRIVEN (Sarah-PM)

<thinking>
Use Sarah-PM to generate a strategic 4-week personalized development roadmap based on project type, team size, experience level, and priorities.
</thinking>

**‚õî BLOCKING STEP - YOU MUST INVOKE SARAH-PM USING THE TASK TOOL:**

**ACTION: Invoke Sarah-PM Agent**
Call the Task tool with:
- `subagent_type: "Sarah-PM"`
- `description: "Generate personalized development roadmap"`
- `prompt: "Generate 4-week personalized development roadmap based on onboarding configuration. Input: Project type (${project_type}), team size (${team_size}), experience level (${experience}), technologies (${technologies}), priorities (${priorities}), selected agents (${active_agents}). Your strategic PM roadmap design: (1) Analyze project context (what type of development will this team do? what are their pain points based on experience level?), (2) Design Week 1 milestones (initial setup, core workflows, agent familiarization - keep it simple for first week), (3) Design Week 2 milestones (intermediate features, quality gates, testing patterns), (4) Design Week 3 milestones (advanced features, optimization, performance), (5) Design Week 4 milestones (production readiness, deployment, monitoring), (6) Recommend agent usage per week (which agents to focus on each week based on milestones), (7) Define quality gates per week (coverage targets, security benchmarks, performance goals), (8) Estimate effort and complexity (realistic timelines based on team size and experience), (9) Identify potential blockers (what might slow this team down? how to mitigate?), (10) Create success metrics (how to measure progress each week). Return: { roadmap_summary: string, weeks: [{week_number, theme, milestones: [{title, description, agent_recommendations: [], estimated_effort, complexity}], quality_gates: [], success_metrics: [], potential_blockers: []}], agent_focus_by_week: {}, overall_timeline: string, recommendations: [] }"`

## Advanced Options

### Re-run Onboarding
```bash
/onboard --reset          # Start fresh (clears existing config)
```

### Export Configuration
```bash
/onboard --export         # Export config to share with team
```

### Import Configuration
```bash
/onboard --import team-config.json    # Use team config
```

### Validate Setup
```bash
/onboard --validate       # Check if setup is complete
```

---

**Implementation Note for Claude**:

When user invokes `/onboard`, you should:

1. **Auto-detect project** (if possible):
   ```typescript
   // Read package.json, analyze dependencies
   // Detect React, TypeScript, Node.js, etc.
   ```

2. **Ask questions progressively** (one section at a time):
   - Don't overwhelm with all questions at once
   - Show current selection after each step
   - Allow back/edit previous answers

3. **Generate configuration**:
   ```typescript
   // Call onboarding-wizard.ts with chat mode:
   const wizard = new OnboardingWizard({ mode: 'chat' });
   await wizard.startOnboarding();
   ```

4. **Create files** (use Write tool):
   - `.versatil/config.json`
   - `.versatil/agents/*.json`
   - `.cursorrules`
   - `CLAUDE.md` (from template)
   - `docs/VERSATIL_ROADMAP.md` (call RoadmapGenerator)

5. **Confirm completion** with visual summary (markdown tables, checkboxes)

6. **Ask about daemon start** (offer to run `versatil-daemon start`)

---

**Visual Elements to Use**:
- ‚úÖ Checkboxes for completed steps
- üìä Tables for options/comparisons
- üìÅ Code blocks for file previews
- üéØ Progress bars (`[‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà----] 60%`)
- üí° Callout boxes for tips
- üîó Clickable links to docs

This creates a **GUI-like experience in chat** without needing a VSCode extension!
