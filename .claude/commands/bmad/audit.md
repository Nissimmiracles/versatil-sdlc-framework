---

Run the **VERSATIL Daily Audit and Health Check System** (Rule 3) for complete framework validation.

## What Gets Checked:
🏥 **System Health**: CPU, memory, disk, network utilization
📊 **Application Performance**: Response times, throughput, error rates
🔒 **Security**: Vulnerability scans, access control, compliance
✅ **Code Quality**: Test coverage, standards, technical debt
🏗️ **Infrastructure**: Service availability, dependency health
📈 **Business Intelligence**: Metrics and KPI tracking

## Audit Categories:
1. **System**: Resource utilization, process health, uptime
2. **Performance**: Response times, throughput, error rates
3. **Security**: OWASP Top 10, access control, compliance (SOC 2, ISO 27001)
4. **Quality**: 85%+ test coverage, code standards, technical debt
5. **Infrastructure**: Service availability, dependency health
6. **Compliance**: Industry standards and certifications

## Auto-Remediation:
✨ Performance optimization triggers (memory cleanup, scaling)
✨ Security patch application for critical vulnerabilities
✨ Quality gate enforcement with automatic blocking
✨ Resource optimization based on usage patterns
✨ Alert escalation with intelligent notification routing

## Reporting:
- Real-time dashboard with health score trending
- Executive summary reports with actionable insights
- Predictive analytics for potential issues
- Compliance certification readiness tracking

## Usage:
```bash
/audit                          # Run full audit
/audit --security              # Security audit only
/audit --performance           # Performance audit only
/audit --quick                 # Quick health check
```

## Schedule:
- **Daily**: Comprehensive audit at 2 AM (configurable)
- **Hourly**: Critical system health checks
- **Real-time**: Performance monitoring and alerting
