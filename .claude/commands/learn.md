# Learn from Completed Work - Compounding Engineering (Codify Phase)

## Introduction

**Codify learnings** from completed features, bugs, or improvements into the RAG system for future use. This implements the "Codify" phase of VELOCITY workflow's Compounding Engineering approach: each unit of work makes subsequent units easier.

**Philosophy**: "Make the next feature 40% faster by learning from this one."

## Flags

- `--roadmap`: Capture learnings from complete roadmap execution (includes all phases, agent performance, effort accuracy)
- `--compare=BRANCH`: Compare with another branch to extract differential learnings
- `--confidence=N`: Set confidence level for patterns (default: 75, range: 0-100)

## Usage Examples

```bash
# Basic learning (single feature)
/learn "Feature: User authentication"

# Roadmap learning (after /roadmap-test execution)
/learn --roadmap "large-feature.yaml completed in 29.9 hours"

# Compare branches to extract patterns
/learn --compare=main "feature/user-auth"

# High-confidence learning only
/learn --confidence=85 "Feature: Payment processing"
```

## Learning Target

<learning_target> #$ARGUMENTS </learning_target>

## Main Tasks

### 1. Identify Completed Work

<thinking>
First, determine what work was completed and gather all artifacts (code changes, tests, docs, todos).
</thinking>

**Work Discovery:**

- [ ] Parse learning target (feature branch, PR number, todo ID, or description)
- [ ] Identify git branch or commit range
- [ ] List all changed files: `git diff main...feature-branch --name-only`
- [ ] Count lines changed: `git diff main...feature-branch --stat`
- [ ] Extract commit messages: `git log main...feature-branch --oneline`

**Artifact Collection:**

- [ ] Code changes (implementation files)
- [ ] Test files (coverage, patterns)
- [ ] Documentation updates (README, inline comments)
- [ ] Todo completion notes (todos/*.md files)
- [ ] Time tracking data (estimated vs actual)

### 2. Extract Patterns (Feedback-Codifier Agent)

<thinking>
Use the feedback-codifier agent to analyze completed work and extract reusable patterns, successful approaches, and lessons learned.
</thinking>

**Pattern Analysis:**

Run feedback-codifier agent on the completed work:

```yaml
Agent: feedback-codifier
Task: "Analyze completed feature and extract learnings"
Input:
  - feature_description: [from commits/todos]
  - code_changes: [diff output]
  - test_coverage: [coverage report]
  - time_spent: [actual effort]
  - success_indicators: [tests passing, deployed, etc.]

Output:
  - successful_patterns: [What worked well]
  - anti_patterns_avoided: [What was avoided]
  - effort_accuracy: [estimated vs actual]
  - reusable_code: [code snippets with file paths]
  - lessons_learned: [key insights]
  - future_improvements: [what could be better]
```

**Pattern Categories:**

- [ ] **Architecture Patterns**: Component structure, API design, database schema
- [ ] **Security Patterns**: Auth implementation, input validation, RLS policies
- [ ] **Performance Patterns**: Query optimization, caching strategies, indexes
- [ ] **Testing Patterns**: Test organization, coverage strategies, fixtures
- [ ] **Developer Experience**: Setup ease, documentation quality, debugging

### 3. Calculate Effort Metrics

<thinking>
Track actual effort vs estimated effort to improve future planning accuracy.
</thinking>

**Effort Analysis:**

- [ ] Extract original estimate from todo file or plan
- [ ] Calculate actual time spent (git commits, work logs)
- [ ] Compute accuracy: `actual / estimated`
- [ ] Identify variance reasons (complexity, dependencies, blockers)
- [ ] Update effort model for similar features

**Metrics to Track:**

```yaml
Feature Metrics:
  feature_name: "User authentication system"
  estimated_effort: "24 hours"
  actual_effort: "28 hours"
  accuracy: 86%
  variance_reason: "OAuth2 integration more complex than expected"

  complexity_factors:
    - database_tables: 3
    - api_endpoints: 5
    - frontend_components: 4
    - test_files: 8
    - dependencies: ["bcrypt", "jsonwebtoken", "passport"]

  success_metrics:
    - tests_passing: true
    - coverage: 92%
    - performance: "< 200ms login"
    - security_audit: "passed OWASP"
```

### 4. Store in RAG System

<thinking>
Embed learnings into vector store for future retrieval during planning phase.
</thinking>

**RAG Storage:**

```typescript
// Save to vector store
await vectorStore.store({
  content: pattern_description,
  metadata: {
    type: 'feature_implementation',
    feature_name: 'User authentication',
    domain: 'security',
    tech_stack: ['Node.js', 'PostgreSQL', 'JWT'],
    effort_hours: 28,
    success_score: 95,
    lessons: ['Add email index early', 'Use httpOnly cookies', 'Test token expiry'],
    code_examples: [
      { file: 'src/auth/jwt-service.ts', lines: '42-67', pattern: 'JWT generation' },
      { file: 'src/auth/middleware.ts', lines: '12-35', pattern: 'Auth middleware' }
    ],
    similar_to: ['feature-123', 'feature-456'],
    tags: ['authentication', 'security', 'jwt', 'oauth2']
  },
  domain: 'feature_implementations',
  timestamp: new Date()
});
```

**Embedding Categories:**

1. **Successful Patterns** (high similarity threshold)
   - "How to implement JWT auth with refresh tokens"
   - "Database schema pattern for multi-tenant SaaS"
   - "React form validation with Zod + React Hook Form"

2. **Lessons Learned** (medium similarity threshold)
   - "Remember to add indexes on foreign keys"
   - "Test RLS policies with multiple users"
   - "Use optimistic locking for concurrent updates"

3. **Code Examples** (low similarity threshold)
   - Specific file paths and line numbers
   - Working implementation snippets
   - Test examples that achieved 90%+ coverage

### 5. Update Planning Templates

<thinking>
If this is a common feature type, update or create a plan template for future use.
</thinking>

**Template Creation:**

- [ ] Determine if feature matches template category (auth, CRUD, dashboard, etc.)
- [ ] Update existing template or create new one
- [ ] Include actual effort data
- [ ] Add code examples and file structure
- [ ] Document common pitfalls and solutions

**Template Format:**

```yaml
# src/templates/plan-templates/auth-system-v2.yaml

name: "Authentication System (OAuth2 + JWT)"
category: "Security"
estimated_effort: "28 hours ¬± 4 hours"  # Updated with actual data
confidence: 95%  # Based on 3 successful implementations

phases:
  database:
    effort: "6 hours"
    tables:
      - users: "email (indexed!), password_hash, created_at"
      - sessions: "token (indexed!), user_id, expires_at"
    lessons:
      - "‚ö†Ô∏è Add index on users.email BEFORE inserting data"
      - "‚úÖ Use UUID for session tokens (better security)"

  api:
    effort: "14 hours"
    endpoints:
      - POST /auth/signup: "Zod validation, bcrypt hashing (12 rounds)"
      - POST /auth/login: "JWT generation, httpOnly cookie"
      - POST /auth/refresh: "Token rotation for security"
      - DELETE /auth/logout: "Clear session, revoke token"
    code_examples:
      - file: "src/auth/jwt-service.ts:42-67"
        pattern: "JWT generation with 24h expiry"
    lessons:
      - "‚úÖ Use httpOnly cookies (not localStorage)"
      - "‚ö†Ô∏è Test token expiry thoroughly"

  frontend:
    effort: "8 hours"
    components:
      - LoginForm: "Email validation, password strength"
      - AuthProvider: "React Context + useAuth hook"
      - ProtectedRoute: "Redirect to /login if not authed"
    code_examples:
      - file: "src/components/auth/LoginForm.tsx:15-45"
        pattern: "Form validation with React Hook Form"

success_metrics:
  - "< 200ms auth endpoint response"
  - "92%+ test coverage achieved"
  - "OWASP Top 10 compliance"
  - "WCAG 2.1 AA accessible forms"

learnings_applied_from:
  - feature-auth-v1 (#123): "Added email index upfront"
  - feature-oauth (#456): "Implemented token refresh"
  - feature-sso (#789): "Used httpOnly cookies"
```

### 6. Generate Learning Report

<thinking>
Create a summary report showing what was learned and how it will help future work.
</thinking>

**Report Structure:**

```markdown
# Learning Report: User Authentication System

**Date**: 2025-10-13
**Feature**: User authentication with OAuth2 + JWT
**Actual Effort**: 28 hours (estimated: 24 hours, 86% accuracy)
**Success Score**: 95/100

## What Worked Well ‚úÖ

1. **JWT Implementation**
   - Used httpOnly cookies for XSS protection
   - Implemented token refresh for better UX
   - 24h expiry with automatic renewal
   - **Saved to RAG**: Pattern "jwt-auth-cookies"

2. **Database Design**
   - Added email index BEFORE data insertion (learned from #123)
   - UUID for session tokens (better than auto-increment)
   - RLS policies tested with 5 different users
   - **Saved to RAG**: Pattern "auth-database-schema"

3. **Testing Strategy**
   - Achieved 92% coverage (target: 80%+)
   - Comprehensive token expiry tests
   - Security tests for SQL injection, XSS, CSRF
   - **Saved to RAG**: Pattern "auth-testing-suite"

## Lessons Learned üìö

1. **OAuth2 Complexity** ‚ö†Ô∏è
   - Initial estimate: 4 hours
   - Actual: 8 hours (2x)
   - Reason: Token refresh logic more complex than expected
   - **Future adjustment**: Add 2x multiplier for OAuth integrations

2. **Index Timing** ‚úÖ
   - Added email index BEFORE inserting users (learned from #123)
   - Prevented performance degradation at scale
   - **Lesson**: Always create indexes before bulk inserts

3. **Cookie Security** ‚úÖ
   - Started with localStorage (insecure)
   - Switched to httpOnly cookies (recommended by #789)
   - Prevented XSS attacks
   - **Lesson**: Always use httpOnly for sensitive tokens

## Reusable Code üìù

Extracted 8 reusable patterns:

1. **JWT Service** (`src/auth/jwt-service.ts:42-67`)
   - Token generation with custom claims
   - Expiry handling
   - Refresh token rotation

2. **Auth Middleware** (`src/auth/middleware.ts:12-35`)
   - Token verification
   - User session restoration
   - Error handling

3. **LoginForm Component** (`src/components/auth/LoginForm.tsx:15-45`)
   - Form validation with React Hook Form
   - Accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA)
   - Error message display

4. **RLS Policies** (`supabase/migrations/003_auth_rls.sql`)
   - User data isolation
   - Session management
   - Admin bypass patterns

## Impact on Future Work üöÄ

**Next Authentication Feature**:
- Estimated effort: **20 hours** (was 28 hours)
- Confidence: **95%** (was 75%)
- Known pitfalls: **8 avoided**
- Code reuse: **60%** (3 of 5 files)

**Template Updated**: `auth-system-v2.yaml`
**RAG Embeddings**: 12 patterns stored
**Plan Accuracy**: Improved from 75% ‚Üí 95%

## Recommended Actions

1. ‚úÖ Apply "httpOnly cookies" pattern to all auth features
2. ‚úÖ Update onboarding docs with OAuth2 complexity notes
3. ‚úÖ Add "early index creation" checklist to DB guidelines
4. ‚è≥ Schedule knowledge share session on JWT best practices

---

**Codified by**: feedback-codifier agent
**Stored in**: RAG vector store (domain: feature_implementations)
**Available for**: Future /plan commands
**Next review**: After 3 more auth features (validate template accuracy)
```

### 7. Update Related Documentation

<thinking>
Ensure lessons learned are captured in relevant docs and guidelines.
</thinking>

**Documentation Updates:**

- [ ] Update `docs/patterns/authentication.md` with new learnings
- [ ] Add to `docs/lessons-learned/security.md`
- [ ] Update `CHANGELOG.md` with pattern improvements
- [ ] Add to team wiki or knowledge base
- [ ] Update onboarding checklist with new best practices

## Output Format

Present the learning report with:

1. **Executive Summary** (2-3 sentences)
2. **Effort Accuracy** (estimated vs actual)
3. **Patterns Extracted** (what worked well)
4. **Lessons Learned** (what to remember)
5. **RAG Embeddings** (what was stored)
6. **Future Impact** (how this helps next time)
7. **Recommended Actions** (what to do with learnings)

## Success Metrics

- **RAG Storage**: 5-15 patterns per feature
- **Template Update**: Effort estimates within ¬±20%
- **Future Accuracy**: 85%+ plan confidence
- **Code Reuse**: 40%+ in similar features
- **Time Savings**: 30-50% on subsequent features

## Integration with /plan Command

When `/plan "Add user authentication"` runs:

1. **RAG Search**: Query vector store for "authentication" patterns
2. **Retrieve Learnings**: Get lessons from previous auth implementations
3. **Apply Estimates**: Use actual effort data (28 hours, not 24)
4. **Suggest Code**: Show reusable examples with file paths
5. **Warn Pitfalls**: "Remember to add email index early"

**Result**: Plans become 40% more accurate with each learning cycle.
