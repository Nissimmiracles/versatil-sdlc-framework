# Multi-Agent Code Review with OPERA

## Introduction

Conduct comprehensive code reviews using VERSATIL's OPERA agents in isolated git worktrees. This command provides parallel multi-perspective analysis for thorough quality assessment before merging.

## Review Target

<review_target> #$ARGUMENTS </review_target>

## Main Tasks

### 1. Setup Isolated Review Environment

<thinking>
Use git worktrees to create isolated review environments, preventing interference with active development work.
</thinking>

**Worktree Creation:**

- [ ] Identify the branch/PR to review (e.g., `feature/auth-system`)
- [ ] Create isolated worktree: `git worktree add ../review-worktree-<timestamp> <branch-name>`
- [ ] Verify worktree is clean and up to date
- [ ] Navigate to worktree directory for analysis

**Changed Files Identification:**

- [ ] Run `git diff main...HEAD --name-only` to list all changed files
- [ ] Categorize files by type (backend, frontend, tests, docs, config)
- [ ] Identify which OPERA agents are relevant for each category
- [ ] Calculate total lines changed: `git diff main...HEAD --shortstat`

### 2. Assign Review Responsibilities

<thinking>
Match file types and changes to appropriate OPERA agents based on their expertise domains.
</thinking>

**Agent Assignment Matrix:**

```yaml

```

### 3. Parallel Multi-Agent Review

<thinking>
Execute reviews in parallel to maximize velocity while maintaining thoroughness. Each agent operates independently within their domain.
</thinking>

**Parallel Execution:**

Run these agents in parallel (Rule 1):

```markdown
- Task marcus-backend(backend_files) - API security, performance, OWASP
- Task james-frontend(frontend_files) - UI/UX, accessibility, performance
- Task maria-qa(test_files, all_files) - Test coverage, quality gates
- Task alex-ba(feature_description) - Requirements alignment
- Task sarah-pm(docs_files) - Documentation completeness
```

### 4. Review Output Collection

<thinking>
Each agent produces structured findings that need synthesis into actionable feedback.
</thinking>

**Finding Categories:**

```markdown
üî¥ CRITICAL (Must Fix Before Merge):
- Security vulnerabilities (OWASP violations)
- Broken functionality
- Test coverage < 80%
- Accessibility violations
- Data loss risks

üü° HIGH PRIORITY (Should Fix):
- Performance issues
- Code quality concerns
- Missing tests for edge cases
- Documentation gaps
- Architectural concerns

üü¢ RECOMMENDATIONS (Nice to Have):
- Refactoring suggestions
- Optimization opportunities
- Code style improvements
- Additional test scenarios
- Documentation enhancements
```

**Agent Output Format:**

Each agent reports findings with:
```markdown

### 5. Synthesis & Final Review Report

<thinking>
Combine all agent findings into a unified, actionable review report with clear next steps.
</thinking>

**Synthesis Process:**

- [ ] Collect all agent reports
- [ ] Identify overlapping concerns (multiple agents flag same issue)
- [ ] Prioritize issues by severity and impact
- [ ] Group related findings
- [ ] Generate consolidated fix recommendations
- [ ] Create TodoWrite tasks for required changes

**Git Worktree**: [worktree-path]
**Review Duration**: [X minutes]
```

### 6. Cleanup & Worktree Removal

<thinking>
After review is complete, clean up the isolated worktree to free disk space.
</thinking>

**Cleanup Steps:**

- [ ] Navigate back to main repository: `cd ../main-repo`
- [ ] Remove worktree: `git worktree remove ../review-worktree-<timestamp>`
- [ ] Prune worktree list: `git worktree prune`
- [ ] Verify cleanup: `git worktree list`

## Review Types

### üîç QUICK REVIEW (< 100 lines changed)

**Agents**: 1-2 relevant agents only
**Focus**: Core functionality and obvious issues
**Duration**: 5-10 minutes

**Example:**
```bash
/versatil:review feature/button-color-fix
‚Üí Runs: James-Frontend only
‚Üí Checks: UI consistency, accessibility, no breaking changes
```

### üìã STANDARD REVIEW (100-500 lines changed)

**Agents**: 3-4 relevant agents
**Focus**: Comprehensive domain-specific review
**Duration**: 15-30 minutes

**Example:**
```bash
/versatil:review feature/user-authentication
‚Üí Runs: Marcus-Backend, James-Frontend, Maria-QA
‚Üí Checks: Security, tests, UI, documentation
```

### üìö COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW (500+ lines changed)

**Agents**: All 6 OPERA agents
**Focus**: Deep multi-perspective analysis
**Duration**: 30-60 minutes

**Example:**
```bash
/versatil:review feature/payment-system
‚Üí Runs: All OPERA agents in parallel
‚Üí Checks: Security, architecture, tests, docs, requirements, project impact
```

## Parallel Execution Pattern

**Rule 1 Integration (Parallel Agent Execution):**

```yaml
Review_Request: "Review feature/auth-system branch"

Step_1_Setup:
  - Create git worktree
  - Identify changed files
  - Categorize by agent domain

Step_2_Parallel_Review (Concurrent):
  Marcus-Backend:
    - Reviews: src/api/auth.ts, src/middleware/jwt.ts
    - Checks: Security, OWASP, performance
    - Duration: ~10 minutes

  James-Frontend (Parallel with Marcus):
    - Reviews: src/components/LoginForm.tsx, src/styles/auth.css
    - Checks: Accessibility, responsive, performance
    - Duration: ~8 minutes

  Maria-QA (Parallel with both):
    - Reviews: All files + tests
    - Checks: Coverage, test quality, edge cases
    - Duration: ~12 minutes

Step_3_Synthesis:
  - Collect all findings
  - Remove duplicates
  - Prioritize by severity
  - Generate unified report

Total_Time: ~12 minutes (parallel) vs ~30 minutes (sequential)
Velocity_Gain: 2.5x faster with Rule 1
```

```

## Git Worktree Benefits

**Why Worktrees for Reviews?**

1. **Isolation**: Review doesn't interfere with active development
2. **Parallel Reviews**: Review multiple PRs simultaneously
3. **Clean State**: Fresh checkout ensures no local changes affect review
4. **Easy Cleanup**: Remove worktree after review without affecting main repo
5. **Branch Switching**: No need to stash changes to switch branches

**Worktree Commands:**

```bash
# Create review worktree
git worktree add ../review-auth feature/auth-system

# List all worktrees
git worktree list

# Remove worktree after review
git worktree remove ../review-auth

# Prune stale worktree references
git worktree prune
```

## AI-Era Review Considerations

- [ ] Code may be AI-generated (validate logic, not just syntax)
- [ ] Check for AI hallucinations (non-existent APIs, incorrect patterns)
- [ ] Verify AI-generated tests actually test meaningful scenarios
- [ ] Ensure AI-generated docs are accurate and complete
- [ ] Review for over-engineering (AI tends to add complexity)
- [ ] Validate performance (AI may not optimize for scale)

## Output Format

Present complete review report with:

1. **Executive Summary** (2-3 sentences)
2. **Approval Status** (‚úÖ/‚ö†Ô∏è/‚ùå)
3. **Critical Issues** (blocking)
4. **High Priority Issues** (should fix)
5. **Recommendations** (nice to have)
6. **TodoWrite Tasks** (for fixing issues)
7. **todos/*.md Files** (persistent tracking)
8. **Quality Gates Status** (pass/fail)
9. **Next Steps** (immediate actions)

---

**Framework Integration:**
- **Rule 1**: Parallel agent execution for maximum velocity
- **Rule 2**: Auto-generate stress tests during review
- **Rule 3**: Daily audits track review completion rates
- **Rule 4**: Zero-config agent activation based on file patterns
- **Rule 5**: Automated release orchestration after review approval
