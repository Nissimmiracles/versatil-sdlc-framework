| **Initial Assessment** | 7 days | We assess severity and impact |
| **Fix Development** | 14-30 days | We develop and test a fix |
| **Patch Release** | ASAP | We release a security patch |
| **Public Disclosure** | 30-90 days | Coordinated disclosure after patch |

### Severity Classification

We use the following severity levels:

- **Critical**: Immediate risk of data breach, RCE, or system compromise
  - Response: Patch within 48 hours, emergency release
- **High**: Significant security risk, potential data exposure
  - Response: Patch within 7 days
- **Medium**: Moderate security risk, limited impact
  - Response: Patch within 30 days
- **Low**: Minor security concern, minimal impact
  - Response: Patch in next regular release

---

## üîí Security Update Process

### For Critical/High Severity Issues

1. **Emergency Patch Release**
   - Immediate fix developed and tested
   - Emergency release published to npm
   - Security advisory published on GitHub
   - Users notified via GitHub, npm, email

2. **Version Numbering**
   - Critical security patches: Increment patch version (e.g., 6.1.0 ‚Üí 6.1.1)
   - Include `[SECURITY]` tag in release notes

### For Medium/Low Severity Issues

- Included in next regular release
- Documented in CHANGELOG.md
- Security advisory published after release

## üîê Security Best Practices for Users

### 1. **Secure Configuration**

**Environment Variables**:
```bash
# Never commit .env files
# Use .env.example as a template
cp .env.example .env

# Secure your API keys
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="sk-ant-..."  # Keep secret
SUPABASE_URL="https://..."      # Keep secret
SUPABASE_KEY="..."              # Keep secret
```

**File Permissions**:
```bash
# Protect sensitive files
chmod 600 .env
chmod 600 ~/.versatil/.env
chmod 700 ~/.versatil/
```

### 2. **Dependency Management**

```bash
# Regularly update dependencies
npm update

# Check for vulnerabilities
npm audit

# Fix vulnerabilities
npm audit fix

# For breaking changes
npm audit fix --force  # Use with caution
```

### 3. **MCP Server Security**

**Restrict MCP Server Access**:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "chrome": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@playwright/mcp"],
      "env": {
        "ALLOWED_ORIGINS": "http://localhost:*"  // Restrict origins
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Validate MCP Inputs**:
- Always validate user inputs before passing to MCP servers
- Use allowlists for URLs, file paths, and commands
- Implement rate limiting for MCP calls

### 4. **Agent Security**

**Isolation**:
- Framework and user project completely separated
- Framework data: `~/.versatil/`
- User project: `$(pwd)`
- Never mix the two

**RAG Memory Security**:
- RAG data stored locally or in Supabase
- Encrypt sensitive data before storing
- Use environment-specific RAG stores

### 5. **Production Deployment**

**Secure Deployment Checklist**:
- [ ] Use environment variables (never hardcode secrets)
- [ ] Enable HTTPS/TLS for all API calls
- [ ] Implement rate limiting
- [ ] Use authentication for MCP servers
- [ ] Regularly rotate API keys
- [ ] Monitor logs for suspicious activity
- [ ] Keep framework updated
