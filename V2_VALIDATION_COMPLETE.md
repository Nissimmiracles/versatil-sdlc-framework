## 🚀 Remaining Tests (4 tests, ~15 minutes)

### Test 3: @-Mentions ⏳
**How to Test**:
```bash
# In Claude Code chat, type:
@maria-qa

# You should see typeahead suggestions
# Select agent and give command
@maria-qa check code quality
```

**Expected Result**: Agent activates via @-mention
**Time**: 2 minutes

---

### Test 4: Hooks System ⏳
**How to Test**:
```bash
# Edit any file in the framework
# Example: src/agents/enhanced-maria.ts
# Add a comment and save
```

**Expected Result**: Quality validation hook triggers automatically
**Time**: 3 minutes

---

### Test 5: /doctor --fix ⏳
**How to Test**:
```bash
# Run auto-fix
/doctor --fix
```

**Expected Result**: Attempts to fix isolation violation
**Time**: 2 minutes

---

### Test 6: /validate Command ⏳
**How to Test**:
```bash
# Run validation
/validate
```

**Expected Result**: Runs isolation + quality validation
**Time**: 2 minutes

---
