- **Dynamic Risk Assessment**: Adjusts risk tolerance based on test coverage
- **Continuous Learning**: Stores context-specific patterns

### 3. **Enhanced Introspective Agent**
```typescript
// src/agents/introspective/enhanced-introspective-agent.ts
```

Now has access to:
- **Opera Orchestrator**: Can create goals for autonomous fixes
- **RAG Memory Store**: Full query and storage capabilities

## 🔍 How Context Awareness Works

### Environment Scanning Flow
```
1. Initial Scan
   ├── Project Structure Analysis
   ├── Technology Detection
   ├── Codebase Analysis
   ├── Quality Assessment
   └── Pattern Recognition
   
2. Store in RAG
   ├── Project Context
   ├── File Metadata
   ├── Architectural Insights
   └── Quality Metrics
   
3. Continuous Monitoring
   ├── File Change Detection
   ├── Real-time Updates
   └── Pattern Learning
```

### Opera Decision Making
```
Goal Received → Scan Environment → Query RAG with Context
     ↓                                        ↓
Adapt Plan ← Select Agents ← Analyze with Full Context
     ↓
Execute with Environment Awareness → Learn & Store
```

### Introspective Agent Workflow
```
Monitor → Detect Issue → Query RAG → Analyze Context
   ↓                                      ↓
Create Fix Goal → Send to Opera → Monitor Execution
   ↓
Learn from Result → Update Patterns → Continuous Improvement
```

## 📊 What Gets Collected

### Project Context Object
```javascript
{
  structure: {
    rootPath: "./project",
    srcPath: "./project/src",
    testPath: "./project/tests",
    directories: ["components", "services", "utils"],
    fileCount: 156,
    totalSize: 2500000
  },
  
  technology: {
    language: "typescript",
    framework: "react",
    typescript: true,
    testing: ["jest", "react-testing-library"],
    dependencies: {
      "react": "^18.0.0",
      "typescript": "^5.0.0"
      // ... all deps
    }
  },
  
  codebase: {
    components: [/* FileInfo[] */],
    apis: [/* FileInfo[] */],
    tests: [/* FileInfo[] */],
    totalLines: 25000,
    languages: { ".ts": 45, ".tsx": 67, ".json": 12 }
  },
  
  quality: {
    testCoverage: 45,
    lintErrors: 23,
    outdatedDeps: 5
  },
  
  patterns: {
    architecture: ["Component-Based", "Service-Oriented"],
    antiPatterns: ["God Objects (3)"],
    conventions: ["ESLint", "Prettier"]
  }
}
```

## 🚀 Usage Examples

### 1. **Opera with Full Context**
```javascript
// When Opera receives a goal
const goal = {
  type: 'feature',
  description: 'Add user authentication'
};

// It now considers:
// - TypeScript project → Type-safe implementation
// - React framework → Use React patterns
// - Low test coverage → Add comprehensive tests
// - Existing auth deps → Reuse or add new ones
```

### 2. **Introspective Agent Autonomous Fix**
```javascript
// Detects issue
const issue = {
  type: 'low-test-coverage',
  current: 45,
  threshold: 70
};

// Creates context-aware fix
const fixGoal = {
  description: 'Improve test coverage to 80%',
  constraints: [
    'Use Jest (detected framework)',
    'Follow existing test patterns',
    'Focus on uncovered components'
  ]
};

// Sends to Opera for execution
```

### 3. **File Change Impact Analysis**
```javascript
// File changed: src/components/Auth.tsx

// Introspective Agent:
// 1. Checks if it's a critical component
// 2. Analyzes test coverage impact
// 3. Verifies TypeScript types
// 4. Creates verification goal if needed
```

## 🔍 Verification

To verify full context awareness:

### 1. **Check Environment Scan**
```javascript
const context = await environmentScanner.scanEnvironment();
console.log(context); // Full project details
```

### 2. **Verify Opera Context**
```javascript
// In any Opera decision
decision.environmentContext // Contains project specifics
```

### 3. **Test Introspective Access**
```javascript
// Introspective agent can:
await this.opera.addGoal(goal); // ✅ Create goals
await vectorMemoryStore.query(); // ✅ Access memories
await environmentScanner.scan(); // ✅ Scan environment
```

## 🎯 Real-World Impact

With full context awareness:

1. **TypeScript Project**: Opera ensures type safety in all generated code
2. **Low Test Coverage**: Automatically prioritizes test creation
3. **Large Files**: Proactively suggests and executes refactoring
4. **Missing Dependencies**: Detects and suggests required packages
5. **Anti-patterns**: Identifies and fixes automatically
