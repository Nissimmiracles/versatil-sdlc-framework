# 🔒 Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We actively support the following versions of the VERSATIL SDLC Framework with security updates:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.x     | ✅ Active Support  |
| 0.x     | ❌ Not Supported   |

## Security Philosophy

The VERSATIL SDLC Framework prioritizes security at every level:

### 🛡️ Framework Security
- **Agent Isolation**: Each OPERA agent operates in isolated contexts
- **MCP Security**: Secure Model Context Protocol implementation
- **Input Validation**: All user inputs are validated and sanitized
- **Secrets Management**: No hardcoded credentials or secrets

### 🔐 Default Security Posture
- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Minimal required permissions
- **Secure by Default**: Security-first configuration
- **Defense in Depth**: Multiple security layers
- **Zero Trust**: Verify all interactions

## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

### 🚨 Critical Security Issues
For **critical security vulnerabilities** that could affect user safety or data:

**📧 Email**: security@versatil-platform.com

**Include in your report:**
- Detailed description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Potential impact assessment
- Suggested mitigation (if any)

### ⏱️ Response Timeline
- **Acknowledgment**: Within 24 hours
- **Initial Assessment**: Within 72 hours
- **Fix Development**: 1-2 weeks (depending on severity)
- **Public Disclosure**: After fix is available

### 🏆 Security Researcher Recognition

## Security Best Practices for Users

### 🔧 Installation Security
```bash
# Always verify package integrity
npm audit

# Use exact versions in production
npm install versatil-sdlc-framework@1.0.0 --exact

# Keep dependencies updated
npm update
```

### 🤖 OPERA Agent Security
- **Context Isolation**: Agents don't share sensitive context
- **Permission Management**: Configure agent access appropriately
- **Audit Trails**: Monitor agent activations and decisions

### 🔗 MCP Integration Security
- **Claude Desktop**: Use official MCP integration only
- **Local Only**: MCP server runs locally, no external connections
- **File Access**: Limited to project directories only

## Security Features

### 🛡️ Built-in Protections
1. **Input Sanitization**: All user inputs are validated
2. **Path Traversal Protection**: Restricted file system access
3. **Dependency Scanning**: Automated vulnerability detection
4. **Secrets Detection**: Prevents credential exposure

### 🔍 Security Monitoring
- **Automated Scans**: Regular dependency vulnerability checks
- **Code Analysis**: Static analysis for security issues
- **Audit Logging**: Track security-relevant operations

## Security Compliance

### 📋 Standards Alignment
- **OWASP Guidelines**: Following web application security standards
- **NIST Framework**: Cybersecurity framework compliance
- **Industry Best Practices**: Regular security review processes

### 🏢 Enterprise Security
For enterprise deployments, additional security measures include:
- **SSO Integration**: Single sign-on support
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive operation tracking
- **Access Controls**: Role-based permission management
- **Data Encryption**: At-rest and in-transit protection

## Vulnerability Disclosure Policy

### 📢 Public Disclosure Process
1. **Private Disclosure**: Initial report to security team
2. **Assessment Period**: 90-day maximum for fix development
3. **Coordinated Release**: Security fix and public disclosure
4. **Post-Disclosure**: Public security advisory publication

### 🎯 Scope
**In Scope:**
- VERSATIL framework core functionality
- OPERA agent implementations
- MCP integration components
- CLI tools and utilities
- Documentation security issues

**Out of Scope:**
- Third-party dependencies (report to upstream)
- Social engineering attacks
- Physical security issues
- Denial of service (unless critical)
