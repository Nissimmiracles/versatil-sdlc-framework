# intelligence/ - AI/ML Decision Engine

## ðŸ“‹ Library Purpose

AI-powered decision making for model selection (o1 vs claude-sonnet), ML pipeline orchestration, feature engineering, and model evaluation. Integrates with RAG system for context-aware predictions.

## ðŸŽ¯ Core Concepts

- **ModelSelector**: Chooses optimal AI model based on task complexity
- **MLPipeline**: Orchestrates training, evaluation, deployment
- **FeatureEngineering**: Extracts features from code/commits for ML models

## âœ… Rules

### DO âœ“
- âœ“ Use o1 for complex reasoning, claude-sonnet for speed
- âœ“ Cache model responses (15-minute TTL)
- âœ“ Monitor token usage and costs

### DON'T âœ—
- âœ— Don't use o1 for simple tasks (expensive)
- âœ— Don't skip model evaluation metrics

## ðŸ”§ Pattern: Model Selection
```typescript
import { modelSelector } from '@/intelligence/model-selector.js';

const model = await modelSelector.select({
  task: 'Plan three-tier auth feature',
  complexity: 'high',
  contextSize: 'large'
});
// Returns: 'o1' for high complexity, 'claude-sonnet-4-5' for low
```
