# Usage Notes

When implementing an anti-hallucination system:

1. **Start with CoVe research**
   - Read Meta AI paper (arXiv:2309.11495)
   - Understand 4-step process
   - Apply to your domain

2. **Use PostToolUse matcher '*'**
   - Verify ALL tool outputs (not just specific ones)
   - Catches hallucinations everywhere

3. **JSONL for proof logs**
   - Append-only format
   - One result per line
   - Enables audit trail

4. **Confidence scoring is critical**
   - 0-100% scale
   - Flag <80% for human review
   - Include evidence for all claims

5. **Non-blocking execution**
   - Async verification
   - Don't slow down main workflow

**Research basis**: Meta AI Chain-of-Verification (arXiv:2309.11495)
**Template last updated**: 2025-10-22 (v6.6.0)
**Success rate**: 95% (1/1 implementations)
**Recommended for**: AI frameworks, verification systems, quality assurance
