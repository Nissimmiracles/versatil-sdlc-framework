/**
 * Test Page Component - Orphaned Page Detection Test
 *
 * This page is intentionally created WITHOUT a route registration
 * to test the architectural validation system.
 *
 * Expected Behavior:
 * - Watcher should detect this as an orphaned page
 * - Warning should appear within 500ms of file save
 * - Pre-commit hook should block commit until route is added
