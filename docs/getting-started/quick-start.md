## 📦 Step 1: Install (30 seconds)

### Option A: NPM (Recommended)
```bash
npm install -g versatil-sdlc-framework@latest
```

### Option B: From Source
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Nissimmiracles/versatil-sdlc-framework.git
cd versatil-sdlc-framework
npm install && npm run build
```

**✓ Installation complete!** You now have access to the `versatil` command globally.

---

## 🎯 Step 2: Initialize Your Project (2 minutes)

Navigate to your project directory and run:

```bash
cd your-project
versatil init
```

**What happens next?** The intelligent onboarding wizard will:

1. 🔍 **Analyze your codebase** (React? Node? Python?)
2. 🤖 **Configure optimal agents** (Frontend? Backend? Both?)
3. 📝 **Create config files** (.versatil-project.json, .cursorrules)
4. 🎯 **Setup quality gates** (pre-commit hooks, coverage thresholds)
5. ✅ **Test agent activation** (verify everything works)

### Example Output:

```bash
🚀 VERSATIL Framework Setup Wizard

📁 Analyzing project structure...
   ✅ Detected: Full-stack project
   ✅ Frontend: React + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS
   ✅ Backend: Node.js + Express + PostgreSQL
   ✅ Testing: Jest + Playwright

🤖 Configuring agents...
   ✅ Maria-QA: Enabled (85%+ test coverage)
   ✅ James-Frontend: Enabled (WCAG 2.1 AA)
   ✅ Marcus-Backend: Enabled (OWASP Top 10)
   ✅ Sarah-PM: Enabled (sprint tracking)
   ✅ Alex-BA: Enabled (requirements)
   ✅ Dr.AI-ML: Disabled (not an ML project)

✅ Setup complete!
```

**✓ Configuration complete!** Agents are now ready to activate automatically.

---

## 🎨 Step 3: Start Coding (2 minutes)

Open any file in your project and **just start coding**. Agents activate automatically based on what you're working on.

### Example 1: Edit a Test File

```bash
# Open a test file
code src/LoginForm.test.tsx
```

**What happens:**
```
🤖 Maria-QA activated automatically
├── Analyzing test coverage for LoginForm...
├── Coverage: 72% (target: 85%)
├── Missing tests detected:
│   • Error handling for invalid email
│   • Loading state during submit
│   • Accessibility keyboard navigation
└── ✅ Suggestions added as inline comments
```

### Example 2: Edit a React Component

```bash
# Open a component file
code src/components/Button.tsx
```

**What happens:**
```
🤖 James-Frontend activated automatically
├── Validating component structure...
├── Accessibility: WCAG 2.1 AA compliant ✅
├── Performance: Core Web Vitals optimized ✅
├── Responsive: Mobile breakpoints verified ✅
└── ⚠️ Suggestion: Add aria-label for icon button
```

### Example 3: Edit an API Endpoint

```bash
# Open an API file
code src/api/auth/login.ts
```

**What happens:**
```
🤖 Marcus-Backend activated automatically
├── Security scan: OWASP Top 10...
├── ✅ Input validation: Implemented
├── ✅ SQL injection: Protected
├── ⚠️ Rate limiting: Missing (critical)
├── Auto-generating stress tests...
└── Stress test: 1000 req/s, 145ms avg response
```

---

## 📊 Step 4: Check Your Status Line

As you code, watch your status line for real-time agent activity:

```bash
🤖 Maria-QA analyzing... │ ████████░░ 80% coverage │ ⚠️ 2 missing tests
```

```bash
🤖 James validating UI... │ ✅ Accessible │ ⚠️ Missing aria-label
```

```bash
🤖 Marcus security scan... │ ✅ OWASP compliant │ ⏱️ 180ms response
```

---

## 🎯 Step 5: Commit with Confidence

When you're ready to commit:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add login form with validation"
```

**Quality gates run automatically:**

```bash
🔐 VERSATIL Pre-Commit Quality Gate

1. Lint Check (ESLint)
   ✅ No errors (0), No warnings (0)

2. Type Check (TypeScript)
   ✅ No type errors

3. Unit Tests (Jest)
   ✅ 47 tests passed
   ✅ Coverage: 87% (target: 85%)

4. Security Scan (SAST)
   ✅ No vulnerabilities detected

✅ Quality Gate: PASSED
✅ Commit allowed
```

**✓ Quality ensured!** Your code meets all standards before it even reaches CI/CD.

## 🎉 You're Done!

**Congratulations!** You now have:

✅ **6 AI agents** working automatically
✅ **Real-time quality feedback** as you code
✅ **Automated quality gates** before every commit
✅ **Zero context loss** across sessions
✅ **3x faster development** velocity

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Agents Not Activating?
```bash
versatil test-activation
```
This tests your agent configuration and shows activation patterns.

### Quality Gates Blocking Commits?
```bash
versatil quality-gate pre-commit
```
Run quality checks manually to see what's failing.
