## 📅 4-Week Development Plan

### Week 1: Foundation & Architecture

**Description**: Establish project structure, standards, and core architecture

**Primary Agents**: Alex-BA, Sarah-PM, Marcus-Backend, Marcus-Node, Marcus-Python

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Review and refine project requirements with Alex-BA
- [ ] Set up development environment and tooling
- [ ] Define coding standards and conventions
- [ ] Create initial project structure
- [ ] Set up version control and branching strategy
- [ ] Configure CI/CD pipeline (if not present)

**Quality Gates**:
- All developers can run project locally
- Linting and formatting rules enforced
- CI/CD pipeline passes on main branch

---

### Week 2: Core Feature Development

**Description**: Implement primary features with quality standards

**Primary Agents**: Maria-QA, Marcus-Backend, Marcus-Node, Marcus-Python

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Implement core API endpoints with validation
- [ ] Set up database schema and migrations
- [ ] Implement authentication and authorization
- [ ] Add error handling and logging
- [ ] Write unit tests for all new code
- [ ] Document API contracts and component interfaces

**Quality Gates**:
- Unit tests for all new code (80%+ coverage)
- Code review by Maria-QA passed
- No critical security vulnerabilities
- Performance benchmarks met

---

### Week 3: Integration & Quality Assurance

**Description**: Integrate components and comprehensive testing

**Primary Agents**: Maria-QA, Marcus-Backend, Marcus-Node, Marcus-Python

**Tasks**:
- [ ] API integration testing with realistic data
- [ ] Load testing and stress testing (Rule 2)
- [ ] Database performance optimization
- [ ] Security penetration testing
- [ ] End-to-end testing of complete workflows
- [ ] Bug triage and resolution
- [ ] Performance profiling and optimization

**Quality Gates**:
- All integration tests passing
- E2E tests covering critical user flows

- Security scan (OWASP) completed
- Performance tests passing (< 200ms API, < 3s page load)

---

### Week 4: Polish & Production Readiness

**Description**: Final optimizations, documentation, and deployment

**Primary Agents**: Sarah-PM, Maria-QA, Marcus-Backend, Marcus-Node, Marcus-Python

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Performance optimization and profiling
- [ ] User acceptance testing (UAT)
- [ ] Complete documentation (API docs, user guides)
- [ ] Deployment automation and rollback procedures

- [ ] Production deployment
- [ ] Post-deployment verification

**Quality Gates**:
- All production checklist items completed
- Documentation reviewed and approved
- Monitoring dashboards operational
- Rollback procedure tested
- Zero critical/high severity issues

---

## 🎯 Quality Strategy

- **Test Enhancement**: Review existing tests, increase coverage to 80%+
- **CI Enhancement**: Add performance testing and security scans to pipeline
- **Security Scanning**: Integrate Snyk or OWASP Dependency-Check
- **API Testing**: Use Postman/Insomnia collections for API validation
- **Load Testing**: Run k6 or Artillery tests, target < 200ms response times
- **Code Review**: Maria-QA reviews all PRs before merging
- **Documentation**: Maintain up-to-date README, API docs, and architecture diagrams

---
