## Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: Can I use VERSATIL with my existing tools?
**A**: Yes! VERSATIL works alongside Copilot, Cursor, etc. Use them for autocomplete, use VERSATIL for multi-agent coordination and quality gates.

### Q: Is VERSATIL really free?
**A**: Yes, 100% free and open source (MIT License). No hidden costs, no tiers, no subscriptions.

### Q: Does VERSATIL work offline?
**A**: Partially. The daemon and quality gates work offline. Claude integration requires internet (same as Copilot/Cursor).

### Q: How much does VERSATIL slow down my workflow?
**A**: It speeds it up by 3.2x! Agents work in the background. Quality gates run pre-commit (catches issues before CI/CD).

### Q: Can I customize agents?
**A**: Yes! VERSATIL is open source. Fork it, modify agents, create new ones. Community contributions welcome.
