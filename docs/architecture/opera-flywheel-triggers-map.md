# OPERA Flywheel Triggers Map

**Version**: 1.0.0
**Date**: 2025-10-19
**Purpose**: Comprehensive mapping of all OPERA flywheel processes and their auto-triggers
**Philosophy**: "Each unit of work makes subsequent units 40% faster through automatic learning and pattern codification"

---

## Executive Summary

**What is a Flywheel?**
A flywheel in VERSATIL is a **self-reinforcing cycle** where each execution makes the next execution faster through pattern learning, automation, and quality improvements.

**The 6 OPERA Flywheels**:
1. **Requirements Flywheel**: Each requirement analysis improves the next
2. **Design Flywheel**: Each architecture decision informs future designs
3. **Development Flywheel**: Each feature adds reusable code patterns
4. **Testing Flywheel**: Each test improves test generation
5. **Deployment Flywheel**: Each release improves automation
6. **Evolution Flywheel**: Each learning cycle compounds improvements

**Compounding Effect**: After 10 iterations, teams report **40-60% faster** feature delivery with **higher quality**.

## Flywheel Monitoring System

**Current Implementation**: [src/tasks/flywheel-monitoring-task.ts](../../src/tasks/flywheel-monitoring-task.ts)

```typescript
// 6 SDLC Flywheels Tracked:
export const FLYWHEEL_TYPES = [
  'requirements',    // Alex-BA, Sarah-PM
  'design',          // Marcus-Backend, James-Frontend, Dana-Database
  'development',     // All OPERA agents
  'testing',         // Maria-QA
  'deployment',      // Sarah-PM
  'evolution'        // All agents (learning from performance)
];

// Metrics Per Flywheel:
export interface FlywheelMetrics {
  momentum: number;          // 0-100 (speed of iterations)
  successRate: number;       // 0-100 (% of successful executions)
  patternsLearned: number;   // Total patterns stored in RAG
  avgExecutionTime: number;  // Minutes per execution
  compoundingFactor: number; // 1.0 = no improvement, 1.4 = 40% faster

## Trigger Priority Matrix

### High Priority (Auto-Execute Immediately)

```yaml
P0_Critical:
  - Task completion (instinctive testing)
  - Production error detected
  - Security vulnerability found
  - Build failure
  - Test failure blocking merge

P1_High:
  - API endpoint modified
  - Database migration created
  - Component accessibility issue
  - Code coverage decreased
  - Daily health audit (2 AM)
```

### Medium Priority (Queue for Execution)

```yaml
P2_Medium:
  - Feature completed (/learn codification)
  - Pattern recognized
  - Refactoring opportunity found
  - Documentation out of date
  - Performance degradation (non-critical)
```

### Low Priority (Batch Processing)

```yaml
P3_Low:
  - Weekly metrics collection
  - Monthly compounding report
  - Quarterly trend analysis
  - Agent performance reviews
  - Long-term pattern analysis
```

## Troubleshooting Flywheel Issues

### Symptom: Flywheel Momentum Decreasing

```yaml
Diagnosis:
  Check: FlywheelMonitoringTask dashboard
  Metric: momentum < 30 (critical threshold)

Common_Causes:
  1. Patterns not being stored in RAG
  2. Agents not learning from past work
  3. /learn command not running
  4. RAG memory retrieval failing
  5. Agent prompts outdated

Fixes:
  1. Run /doctor --fix to validate RAG connection
  2. Manually run /learn on recent features
  3. Check RAG query logs for errors
  4. Update agent prompts with new patterns
  5. Run FlywheelHealthMonitor.autoOptimize()
```

### Symptom: Compounding Not Happening (Still Slow)

```yaml
Diagnosis:
  Check: Effort estimate accuracy not improving
  Metric: Same time per feature after 10 iterations

Common_Causes:
  1. Pattern reuse rate < 30%
  2. Each feature is completely unique
  3. Agents working in isolation (no RAG queries)
  4. Quality patterns not being codified
  5. Team not using pattern library

Fixes:
  1. Audit RAG queries (should be 20+ per feature)
  2. Identify common patterns manually
  3. Seed RAG with baseline patterns
  4. Train team to check pattern library first
  5. Update agent prompts to query RAG more
```

## Success Stories

### Example: API Endpoint Evolution

```yaml
Iteration_1:
  Feature: "Create /api/users endpoint"
  Time: 4 hours
  Test_Coverage: 60%
  Bugs: 2
  Learning: "Stored auth pattern, validation pattern"

Iteration_2:
  Feature: "Create /api/posts endpoint"
  Time: 3 hours (25% faster)
  Test_Coverage: 78%
  Bugs: 1
  Learning: "Reused auth, stored pagination pattern"

Iteration_5:
  Feature: "Create /api/comments endpoint"
  Time: 1.5 hours (63% faster)
  Test_Coverage: 85%
  Bugs: 0
  Learning: "Reused auth, pagination, validation, CRUD patterns"

Iteration_10:
  Feature: "Create /api/notifications endpoint"
  Time: 45 minutes (81% faster!)
  Test_Coverage: 88%
  Bugs: 0
  Learning: "Almost fully automated using pattern library"

Compounding_Result:
  - 81% faster implementation
  - 28% higher coverage
  - 100% fewer bugs
  - Patterns stored: 12 (auth, validation, CRUD, pagination, etc.)
```

## FAQ

### Q: How do I know if flywheels are working?
**A**: Run `/monitor dashboard` to see flywheel health metrics. Momentum should be 50-100, success rate > 90%, compounding factor > 1.2.

### Q: What if compounding stops after 5 iterations?
**A**: Normal! Diminishing returns kick in. Expect 40% gains initially, then 15-20%, settling at 10-15% per iteration.

### Q: Can I disable specific flywheels?
**A**: Yes, in `.versatil/config.yaml`. But not recommended - flywheels work best together.

### Q: How long until I see results?
**A**: Immediate for testing flywheel (instinctive testing). 2-3 weeks for development flywheel. 1-2 months for full compounding effect.

### Q: What if my features are all unique?
**A**: Even unique features share patterns (auth, validation, error handling, testing). Start with common patterns, expand from there.
