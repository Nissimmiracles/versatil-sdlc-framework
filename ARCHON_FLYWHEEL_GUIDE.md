# 🎯 Opera & SDLC Flywheel Integration Guide

## Overview

Opera is the **autonomous orchestrator** that sits at the center of the VERSATIL SDLC flywheel, coordinating all phases and agents.

## How Opera Works in Each Phase

### 1. **Requirements Phase**
```javascript
// User sets a high-level goal
opera.addGoal({
  type: 'feature',
  description: 'Add user authentication with 2FA',
  priority: 'high',
  constraints: ['Use JWT', 'Support OAuth', 'Mobile-friendly'],
  successCriteria: ['All tests pass', '< 200ms response time']
});
```

**Opera Actions**:
- Decomposes goal into tasks
- Assigns to appropriate agents
- Creates execution plan

### 2. **Analysis Phase**
- **Alex-BA** analyzes requirements
- Opera queries RAG memory for similar past projects
- Identifies patterns and best practices
- Makes autonomous decisions on approach

### 3. **Design Phase**
- **Dan-Architect** creates technical design
- Opera validates against constraints
- Checks memory for architectural patterns
- Autonomously adjusts design based on learnings

### 4. **Development Phase**
- **Marcus/James** implement features
- Opera monitors progress
- Detects blockers and reassigns tasks
- Applies learned code patterns from RAG

### 5. **Testing Phase**
- **Maria** runs comprehensive tests
- Opera analyzes results
- Decides if quality gates are met
- Triggers fixes autonomously if needed

### 6. **Deployment Phase**
- **DevOps-Dan** handles deployment
- Opera monitors metrics
- Ready to rollback if issues detected
- Learns from deployment patterns

### 7. **Monitoring Phase**
- Continuous health checks
- Opera detects anomalies
- Triggers autonomous fixes
- Stores patterns in RAG

### 8. **Feedback Phase**
- Collects user feedback
- Opera prioritizes improvements
- Creates new goals autonomously
- Feeds learning back to RAG

## Opera Decision Flow

```javascript
// Example: Autonomous bug fix
if (monitoring.detectsIssue('high CPU usage')) {
  // 1. Query RAG for similar issues
  const memories = await rag.query('high CPU usage patterns');
  
  // 2. Create goal
  const goal = {
    type: 'bug_fix',
    description: 'Fix high CPU usage in user service',
    priority: 'critical'
  };
  
  // 3. Plan execution
  const plan = opera.createPlan(goal, memories);
  
  // 4. Execute autonomously
  await opera.executeПлан(plan);
  
  // 5. Validate fix
  if (monitoring.issueResolved()) {
    rag.storePattern('CPU fix', solution);
  }
}
```

## Key Integration Points

### RAG + Opera
- Every decision queries past experiences
- Successful outcomes stored as patterns
- Failed attempts stored as anti-patterns
- Continuous improvement loop

### Agents + Opera
- Opera coordinates agent activities
- Manages handoffs between agents
- Resolves conflicts in recommendations
- Optimizes agent utilization

### Flywheel + Opera
- Opera ensures smooth phase transitions
- Quality gates enforced automatically
- Parallel execution where possible
- Zero context loss between phases

## Configuration

```javascript
// .versatil/opera/config.json
{
  "version": "1.2.0",
  "autonomousMode": true,
  "decisionConfidenceThreshold": 0.7,
  "maxConcurrentGoals": 5,
  "learningRate": 0.1,
  "flywheelPhases": {
    "requirements": { "requiredAgents": ["alex-ba", "sarah-pm"] },
    "analysis": { "requiredAgents": ["alex-ba", "enhanced-maria"] },
    "design": { "requiredAgents": ["architecture-dan"] },
    "development": { "requiredAgents": ["enhanced-marcus", "enhanced-james"] },
    "testing": { "requiredAgents": ["enhanced-maria", "security-sam"] },
    "deployment": { "requiredAgents": ["devops-dan"] },
    "monitoring": { "requiredAgents": ["introspective-agent"] },
    "feedback": { "requiredAgents": ["sarah-pm", "alex-ba"] }
  }
}
```

## Usage Examples

### Autonomous Feature Development
```javascript
// One command builds entire feature
await opera.addGoal({
  type: 'feature',
  description: 'Build shopping cart with checkout',
  priority: 'high'
});

// Opera handles everything:
// - Requirements gathering
// - Technical design
// - Implementation
// - Testing
// - Deployment
// - Monitoring
```

### Self-Healing Production Issue
```javascript
// Opera detects issue
monitoring.on('alert', async (issue) => {
  if (issue.severity === 'critical') {
    await opera.addGoal({
      type: 'bug_fix',
      description: issue.description,
      priority: 'critical',
      constraints: ['Zero downtime', 'Preserve data']
    });
  }
});
```

## Benefits

1. **Autonomous Execution**: Set goals, not tasks
2. **Continuous Learning**: Every cycle improves
3. **Context Preservation**: Nothing lost between phases
4. **Intelligent Decisions**: Based on past experiences
5. **Self-Healing**: Fixes issues without human intervention

The SDLC flywheel with Opera transforms development from a linear process to an intelligent, self-improving cycle. Each rotation makes the system smarter and faster.
