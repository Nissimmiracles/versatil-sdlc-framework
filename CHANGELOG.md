  2. Install MCP dependencies? (Y/n) ← NEW
  3. See getting started guide

- **Getting Started Guide Updates** - Added MCP installation to tips section
  - "Install MCP dependencies: npm run install-mcps"
  - Users reminded about MCP installation even if they skip during setup

#### **CI/CD Enhancements**
- **CI Detection** - Automatically skips MCP installation in CI environments
- **skipOptionalDependencies: true** - Optimized CI preferences
- **Clear Messaging** - Informative output about MCP dependencies being skipped

### Changed

#### **Installation Script (`scripts/install-mcps.sh`)**

- ✅ **No Extra Steps**: MCP installation integrated into workflow
- ✅ **User Choice**: Optional - users can skip and install later
- ✅ **Graceful Fallbacks**: Clear error messages and fallback instructions
- ✅ **CI-Friendly**: Automatically skips in CI/CD environments

### Usage

**First-Time Installation:**
```bash
npm install -g versatil-sdlc-framework
# → Postinstall wizard runs
# → Prompts for configuration
# → Prompts for MCP installation ← NEW
# → Shows getting started guide
```

**Manual MCP Installation:**
```bash
npm run install-mcps
# Or directly:
bash scripts/install-mcps.sh
```

### Technical Details

- **File**: `scripts/postinstall-wizard.cjs` (54 lines added)
- **Function**: `promptMCPInstallation()` - Handles MCP installation flow
